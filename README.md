## Learn Large Language Modelling

This repository contain my practice on LLM concept, especially for BERT, GPT2, and T5 model as pretrained model with: 

a. Tokenization \
b. Masked Language Modelling \
c. Next Sentence Prediction \
d. Sequence Classification \
e. Token Classification \
f. Question Answering with Encoder Pretrained Model \
g. Text Generation \
h. Prompt Engineering \
i. Semantic Search \
j. Multitask Learning \
k. Abstractive Summarization \
l. Reinforcement Learning \
m. Deep Reinforcement Learning 

Glad if this can be help for you ^^
