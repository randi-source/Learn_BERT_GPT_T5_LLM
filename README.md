## Learn Large Language Modelling

This repository contain my practice on LLM concept, especially for BERT, GPT2, and T5 model as pretrained model with: \n
a. Tokenization \n
b. Masked Language Modelling \n
c. Next Sentence Prediction \n
d. Sequence Classification \n
e. Token Classification \n
f. Question Answering with Encoder Pretrained Model \n
g. Text Generation \n
h. Prompt Engineering \n
i. Semantic Search \n
j. Multitask Learning \n
k. Abstractive Summarization \n
l. Reinforcement Learning \n
m. Deep Reinforcement Learning \n 

Glad if this can be help for you ^^
